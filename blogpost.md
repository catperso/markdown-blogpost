Pizza is definitely my favourite food! You can put _whatever_ toppings you want onto it, it's the pinnacle of customization! And with the right choices, the right pizza can satisfy every food group **at the same time**! Few other foods can claim to accomplish as much or be as broadly accepted as pizza is.

## My favourite pizza elements

My all-time favourite option for a pizza: **White Sauce**. Everyone uses the same boring red sauce for pizza, but a nice garlic-y white sauce will mellow out the acidity of the pizza and provide a greater depth of flavour (in my opinion!)
Other toppings that I prefer, in no particular order:
* Bacon
* Pineapple (it belongs on pizza, accept it!)
* Salami
* Pepperoncini
* Prosciutto
But I'm not terribly picky, and if there's pizza around I'll aim for a slice no matter the toppings!
